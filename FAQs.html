                How will you improve our country?
            </p>
            <p>
                I will work to improve our infrastructure. Something that will help our nation grow and thrive, 
                such as infrastructure, is crucial to our nation. It is far behind other countries and has been 
                pushed aside by other politicians who prefer to do what is more beneficial to their own careers, 
                such as increasing welfare programs or lowering taxes. While these things help some individuals 
                and look suitable for the police, it is necessary to do what needs to be done before these things.

                What will you do about the Ukraine War?
            </p>
            <p>
                The war in Ukraine is not an issue the US should be involved in. Europe has always been 
                at war long before our nation was founded. It should be the responsibility of those in 
                Europe to handle their affairs. Countries around Ukraine should help them, and efforts 
                should be made to reach a peaceful agreement between the two countries. By the money 
                doctrine, which has helped our nation become powerful, we should not interfere with the 
                issues of Europe. Although we have strayed from this, our first president, who set many 
                precedents we still use today, said that making permanent alliances (such as NATO) would 
                be a mistake for this country.

                What will you do about the economy and national debt?
            </p>
            <p>
                I will work with Congress to fix budget plans to first stop the US from overspending and then work 
                to bring down the debt that we do have to work to a future where our children will not have to worry 
                about the decisions that we have made that increased our national debt to the excessive amounts that 
                we currently have. Fixing this issue will not be easy, and it has troubled many politicians before me, 
                but handling this issue straight forward is the best solution.
