            <p>
                We are the Bull Moose Party. It was initially started After Teddy Roosevelt lost the Republican nomination 
                in June 1912 at the Chicago convention. The Progressive Party was popularly nicknamed the "Bull Moose Party" 
                when Roosevelt boasted that he felt "strong as a bull moose." We also feel as strong as a Bull Moose and 
                will work to fight for the rights of individuals and states. The federal government has long overreached 
                its powers and should be backed down. Limiting the government and its regulations is necessary, and steps 
                will need to be taken to ensure that the peace does not fail when the government is reduced. We want to 
                minimize taxes and plan to do so only after a system is set up to reduce the national debt. We will also 
                work to bring down the illegal immigration problem. It will start as a significant cost, but over time, 
                it will save us money in the long run.

            <p>Infrasturcture</p>
            <p>
                Our current infrastructure is outdated. It's just plain fact. 
                Once our nation was the strongest in terms of our power grids, roads, and railways. 
                Now, we are falling behind. We must upgrade and build a better power grid to support our energy consumption. 
                Build smoother and better roads to prepare for the future of automation. 
                Upgrade to fiber-wire internet on a nationwide scale to support the need for faster internet. 
                We need to regain the lead that we have lost.

            <p>Defense</p>
            <p>
                We believe that keeping America safe is an important issue and that failing to protect the 
                safety of its citizens is the worst thing a government can do. 
                The primary job of a government is to protect its citizens, and America is failing with this job.

            <p>Gun Rights</p>
            <p>
                The constitution says that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed upon. 
                Therefore we must do whatever is necessary to defend the individual's rights.

            <p>Entitlements</p>
            <p>
                We spend too much. Our nation is crippled in its current debt. We need to stop unnecessary and cumbersome entitlements from being 
                approved in Congress. We need to control our spending so our children will still have money to spend.

            <p>Abortions</p>
            <p>
                Every child should have a chance to live in this world. We strive to abolish abortion on a nationwide 
                level and give the children of this nation a future where they can live.
